# Travel By Car: An OpenGL Project

## Description

- This is a computer graphics project I did in my university project using GLUT.  

- The main representative of our project is based on a particular object, a Car, having multiple scenarios on the background that will be changing by time accordingly.  

- Main objectives that are added in the project includes the sun, moon, clouds, birds, trees, river, mountain, ground, road, car, boat, ship etc.  

- In addition, the graphics will be used to illustrate seasonal changes, changes in weather such as windy or rainy or snowy. There will also be changes in the day and night time view.  

- In short, the project is to portray different places and scenario while travelling by a car, with all the other changes alongside.
