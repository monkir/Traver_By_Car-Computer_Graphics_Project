# Travel By Car: An OpenGL Project

## Description

- This is a computer graphics project I did in my university project using GLUT.  

- The main representative of our project is based on a particular object, a Car, having multiple scenarios in the background that will be changing over time accordingly.  

- The main objectives that are added in the project include the sun, moon, clouds, birds, trees, river, mountain, ground, road, car, boat, ship, etc.  

- In addition, the graphics will be used to illustrate seasonal changes, and changes in weather such as windy rainy, or snowy. There will also be changes in the day and night time view.  

- In short, the project is to portray different places and scenarios while traveling by car, with all the other changes alongside.
